An open source teleprompter software for TV stations. Language used in the program is Chinese now, but I hope i18n will be available.

Cross platform will be available.

The repository is not the latest revision due to https connection issues recently. (2012.9.4)

Connection ok. Code uploaded. (2012.9.14)

This program works more fluently with Windows 7, especially for some old CPUs.

For some old CPUs, you can try the ls-optimize or ls-img-array branch to increase performance.

This program has already tested and used in a school TV station.
